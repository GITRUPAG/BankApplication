# BankApplication
🏦 Bank Application (In Progress)
This is a simple console-based bank application built using Java. The application currently allows users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their account balance. This project is intended to demonstrate basic Java programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, exception handling, JDBC for database operations, and user input handling. Future enhancements will include a frontend interface, additional features, and transitioning to Spring Boot for better structure and scalability.
